  (* data in the wild:
     - a request comes in hdr, q
       - q to be found in cache
       - q not found in cache (to be forwarded to the recursive resolver)
         - unless q in transit (this to-be-done if it is worth it (is it?))
         - a fresh hdr, q is generated and sent to the recursive resolver
         - now hdr, q is registered to be awaited for
         -- we can either signal the request task once we found something,
            or preserve the original hdr, q together with ip and port
     - a reply goes out hdr, q, answer

     the "Client" is only concerned about the connection to the resolver, with
     multiplexing.

     the current API is:
      dns_client calls connect .. -> flow
                       send flow data
                       recv flow (* potentially multiple times *)

     i.e. our flow being (int * _):
       connect <nothing>
       send (id, _) data <- id <- data[2..3]
       recv (id, _) <- registers condition in N[id] ; waits ; removes condition

     or phrased differently:
       a recv_loop reads continously, whenever a full packet is received,
        N[id] is woken up with the packet
  *)
