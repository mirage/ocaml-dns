val resolve_external : t -> Ipaddr.t * int -> string -> (int32 * string) Lwt.t
(** [resolve_external t (ip, port) data] resolves for [(ip, port)] the query
    [data] and returns a pair of the minimum TTL and a response. *)

val primary_data : t -> Dns_trie.t
(** [primary_data t] is the DNS trie of the primary for the resolver [t]. *)

val update_primary_data : t -> Dns_trie.t -> unit
(** [update_primary_data t data] updates the primary for the resolver [t]
    with the DNS trie [data]. Any 'notify's to secondaries are discarded -
    secondary name servers are not supported in this setup. *)

val update_tls : t -> Tls.Config.server -> unit
(** [update_tls t tls_config] updates the tls configuration to [tls_config].
    If the resolver wasn't already listening for TLS connections it will
    start listening. *)
