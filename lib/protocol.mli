  (** [marshal query] is a list of context-buffer pairs corresponding to the
      channel contexts and request buffers with which to attempt DNS requests.
      Requests are made in parallel and the first response to successfully
      parse is returned as the answer. Lagging requests are kept running until
      successful parse or timeout. With this behavior, it is easy to construct
      low-latency but network-environment-aware DNS resolvers.
