(** Interface to 256-way radix trie for DNS lookups.
    Non-standard behaviour: 
    + We don't support '\000' as a character in labels (because it has a
    special meaning in the internal radix trie keys).
    + We don't support RFC2673 bitstring labels. Could be done but they're not
    worth the bother: nobody uses them.
