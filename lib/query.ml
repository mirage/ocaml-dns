  (* We must avoid repeating RRSets in the response.  To do this, we
     keep two lists: one of RRSets that are already included, and one of
     RRSets we plan to put in the additional records section.  When we
     add an RRSet to the answer or authority section we strip it from
     the additionals queue, and when we enqueue an additional RRSet we
     make sure it's not already been included.  
     N.B. (1) We only log those types that might turn up more than once. 
     N.B. (2) We can use "==" and "!=" because owners are unique:
     they are either the owner field of a dnsnode from the 
     trie, or they are the qname, which only happens if it 
     does not have any RRSets of its own and matched a wildcard.*)
