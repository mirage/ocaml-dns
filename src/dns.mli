(** µDNS - an opinionated Domain Name System (DNS) library

    The Domain Name System is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system
   used on the Internet. It associates domain names with nearly arbitrary
   information. Best known is the translation of easily memoizable domain names
   to numerical IP addresses, which are used by computers for establishing
   communication channels - so called {{!A}address} records. DNS has been
   deployed since 1985 on the Internet. It is a widely deployed, fault-tolerant,
   distributed key-value store with built-in caching mechanisms. The keys
   are {{!Domain_name}domain names} and {{!Rr_map.k}record types}, the
   values are {{!Rr_map.rr}record sets}. Each record set has a time-to-live
   associated with it: the maximum time this entry may be cached. The
   {{:https://github.com/hannesm/domain-name}domain name} library provides
   operations on domain names. Hostnames are domain names with further
   restrictions: Only letters, digits, and hyphen are allowed. Domain name
   comparison is usually done ignoring the case.

    A set of 13 authoritative name servers form the root zone which delegate
   authority for subdomains to registrars (using country codes, etc.), which
   delegate domains to individuals who host their Internet presence there.

    The delegation mechanism utilizes the DNS protocol itself, using
   {{!Ns}name server} records, and {{!Soa}start of authority} records. The
   globally federated eMail system uses {{!Mx}mail exchange} records.

    Each Internet domain has at least two authoritative name servers registered
   to enable fault tolerance. To keep these synchronised, a zone transfer
   mechanism is part of DNS. In-protocol DNS extension mechanisms include
   dynamic updates, authentication, and notifications, which allow arbitrary
   synchronized, authenticated modifications.

    From a client perspective, the C library functions [gethostbyname] or
   [getaddrinfo] are mainly used, which receive a string (and a record type)
   and return a reply. A client requests a caching recursive resolver hosted
   close to the client - e.g. at their ISP, and awaits an answer. The recursive
   resolver iterates over the domain name parts, and requests the registered
   authoritative name servers, until the name server responsible for the
   requested domain name is found.

    The core µDNS library includes type definitions of supported record types,
   decoding and encoding thereof to the binary protocol used on the Internet,
   also serialising and parsing of the standardized text form. The record types
   and their values are defined by the {{!Rr_map.k}key} type, which has for
   each record type a specific value type, using a generalized algebraic data
   type -- i.e. an address record may only contain a time-to-live and a set of
   IPv4 addresses. This is used to construct a {{!Gmap}map} data structure.

    This core µDNS library is used by various DNS components:
    {ul
    {- {!Dns_tsig} implements TSIG authentication}
    {- {!Dns_server} implements an authoritative server}
    {- {!Dns_client} implements a client}
    {- {!Dns_zone} implements a zone file parser}
    {- {!Dns_resolver} implements a recursive resolver}}

    These core libraries are pure, i.e. it is independent of network
   communnication, uses immutable values, and errors are explicit as {!result}
   type. Timestamps are passed in to the main handle functions. Some components,
   such as a secondary server, which needs to check freshness of its data in
   regular intervals. The logic is implemented and exposed as function, which
   needs to be called from a side-effecting layer.

    For the client library, several side-effecting layers are implemented:
   [dns-client.unix] uses the blocking [Unix] API (distributed with the OCaml
   runtime), [dns-client.lwt] uses the non-blocking [Lwt] API, and
   [dns-client.mirage] using MirageOS interfaces. Unix command line utilities
   are provided in the [dns-cli] package.

    For the server and resolver components, side-effecting implementations
   using MirageOS interfaces are provided in [dns-server.mirage] and
   [dns-resolver.mirage].
   {{:https://github.com/roburio/unikernels}Example unikernels} are provided
   externally, including authoritative primary and secondary servers, recursive
   and stub resolvers. The certificate authority
   {{:https://letsencrypt}Let's Encrypt} implements a protocol (ACME) which
   automatically provisions X.509 certificates (which are trusted by common
   web browsers); one of the methods to produce proof of ownership is with a DNS
   {{!Txt}TXT} record. Together with
   {{:https://github.com/mmaker/ocaml-letsencrypt}ocaml-letsencrypt}, this DNS
   library can be used to provision certificate signing requests for the
   domain where you run an authoritative server. The
   certificate signing request and certificate are both stored as {{!Tlsa}TLSA}
   records in DNS.
