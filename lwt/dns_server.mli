(** The main purpose of this module is to provide an implementation of a
    standard DNS server based on {!Dns.Query} and {!Dns.Loader}.

    For a basic DNS server, call {!process_of_zonebuf}, pass
    the result to {!processor_of_process}, and then invoke
    the resulting processor function for each received packet.

    This module also provides a way to override the parsing and marshaling of
    DNS packets to allow extensions of DNS to be implemented, such as DNSCurve.

(** A tuple consisting of an IPv4 or IPv6 address and a TCP or UDP port number. *)
type ip_endpoint = Ipaddr.t * int

(** A type of function that takes an abstract request plus source and destination
    endpoint addresses, and asynchronously produces an answer to the request,
    or None if no answer is possible. For most applications the type {!'a}
    will be {!Dns.Packet.t}, but may be different if a custom parsing/marshalling
    layer is required.
*)
type 'a process = src:ip_endpoint -> dst:ip_endpoint -> 'a -> Dns.Query.answer option Lwt.t

(** This type of module provides functions for parsing, marshalling and processing
    DNS requests to produce answers. *)

  include Dns.Protocol.SERVER

  (** DNS responder function.
      Takes an abstract request plus source and destination
      endpoint addresses, and asynchronously produces an answer to the request,
      or None if no answer is possible. *)

type 'a processor = (module PROCESSOR with type context = 'a)

(** [compose process backup_process] is [process] unless it returns 
	an {!rcode} other than {!NoError} in which case it becomes [backup_process]. *)

(** Returns a packet processor module by combining {!Dns.Protocol.Server} with
    the specified packet processing function. *)
val processor_of_process : Dns.Packet.t process -> Dns.Packet.t processor

(** Given a list of DNS zone files as strings, parses them
    using {!Dns.Loader} and returns a processing
    function that answers requests through the use of {!Dns.Query}. *)
val process_of_zonebufs : string list -> Dns.Packet.t process

(** This is a convenience function that is equivalent to calling
    {!process_of_zonebufs} with a list containing a single zone file string. *)
